The purpose of this project was to get familiar with the Spotify API and to practice with general data science techniques using the pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and sci-kit learn libraries. In order, this notebook does the following:

- Plots my top artists (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) vs. their popularity levels
- Plots my top tracks (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) vs. their durations
- Builds and evaluates machine learning models that categorize whether or not a song belongs to a more high energy workout playlist or to a more chill and relaxed playlist
